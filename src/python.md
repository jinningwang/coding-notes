## üß† Static methods, instance methods, and class methods

- üöÄ Instance methods know everything about a specific object.
- üè≠ Class methods know about the class itself, but not about any specific object.
- üß∞ Static methods know nothing about the class or the object. They're just
  function living inside the class for organization.

### üöÄ Instance Method

You should call an instance method on a specific instance, not the class itself.
An instance method needs the data tied to that particular object to do its job.

Imagine a `Circuit` class.
`circuit_a` and `circuit_b` are two different instances.

```Python
class Circuit:
    def __init__(self, voltage, current):
        self.voltage = voltage
        self.current = current

    def calculate_power(self):
        # This method uses instance-specific data (self.voltage, self.current)
        return self.voltage * self.current

# Create two instances
circuit_a = Circuit(120, 5)
circuit_b = Circuit(240, 10)

# Call the instance method on a specific instance
power_a = circuit_a.calculate_power()
power_b = circuit_b.calculate_power()
```

üö´ Calling `Circuit.calculate_power()` would raise an error because the method
wouldn't know which `voltage` or `current` to use.

### üè≠ Class Method

A class method can be called on either the **class itself** or an**instance**
of the class.
It's just a convention to call it on the class.
When called on an instance, the method still receives the class (`cls`) as its
first argument, not the instance (`self`).
This makes class methods powerful for creating alternative constructors or
factory methods, as they always know which class they belong to, even with inheritance.

Let's add a class method to our `Circuit` class that creates an instance from a string.

```Python
class Circuit:
    # ... (same __init__ and calculate_power as above) ...

    @classmethod
    def from_string(cls, circuit_data):
        voltage, current = map(int, circuit_data.split(','))
        return cls(voltage, current)

# Call the class method on the class
circuit_c = Circuit.from_string("12,3") 

# This is also valid, though less common and can be confusing
circuit_d = circuit_c.from_string("15,4")
```

üéØ Both `Circuit.from_string()` and `circuit_c.from_string()` work
and return a new instance of Circuit.
The key is that the method's first argument, `cls`, always refers
to the `Circuit` class, regardless of how it's called.

## üß∞ Static Method vs. Standalone Function

The choice between a static method and a standalone function is about organization
and logical grouping.

Use a static method when the function is logically related to the class and its
purpose, but does not need to access any instance or class-specific data.

- Example: A `get_power_factor` method in a `PowerSystem` class that just takes voltage
  and current and returns a calculated value.
  It makes sense for this function to be inside the `PowerSystem` class because it's
  a core concept of power systems, but it doesn't need to know anything about a
  particular PowerSystem instance.

Use a standalone function in a module when the function is a general utility that
doesn't have a strong logical tie to any specific class.

- Example: A `log_message` function that writes a message to a log file.
  It's a general-purpose utility that could be used by many different classes or parts
  of your program.
  Putting it in a `utils.py` module as a standalone function is cleaner than making
  it a static method of a class it has no real connection to.

‚úÖ The main benefit of a static method is readability and encapsulation.
It tells other developers, "This function belongs here, but it's a simple,
self-contained operation."

## Matrices storage

When working with **large-scale, highly sparse matrices** in power system
analysis,
choosing the right storage format is essential for performance and
interoperability.

| Format        | Best Use Case                          | Portability | Efficiency | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-------|
| `.npz` (SciPy) | Python workflows, fast I/O             | Medium      | High       | Best for Python |
| `.mtx`        | Cross-platform sharing, academic use   | High        | Medium     | Text-based |
| `.h5`         | Large-scale, structured data storage   | High        | High       | Scalable |
| `.csv`        | Simple tabular data (not sparse)       | High        | Low        | Avoid for sparse |

**CSV** is inefficient for sparse matrices due to large file size and lack of sparsity preservation.

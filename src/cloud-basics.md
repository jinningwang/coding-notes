# Cloud Computing Core Concepts

## Cloud Computing Basics

> Definition: leveraging pools of computing resources to minimize cost and
> maximize compute efficiency.

> Definition: allowing individuals and businesses to access and use computing
> resources without significant investment in physical infrastructure.

Five deployment models:

- Private cloud
- Public cloud
- Hybrid cloud: any configuration where a public cloud works with an existing system
  on premises to deploy solutions for the business.
- Multicould

Three delivery models: 

- software as a service (SaaS): an application you rent over the open internet
- platform as a service (PaaS): storage, compute, and other infrastructure services
  that you leverage from some local or remote resource
- infrastructure as a servoce (IaaS): application development, testing, and
  deployment that are available on demand

Why we need cloud networking

- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Cost-Effectiveness
- Accessibility
- Security and Reliability
- Innovation and Agility

> Flexibility are the ability **to change the cloud network without much
> latency**. This means that the network can adapt to the business continuously.
> It's an imperative if the network will provide the most value to the company.

> Innovation and agility are the ability of the cloud network **to support
> any new systems and processes needed** to support innovation within the business.
> Also, the ability **to change the network as required**, which is agility, allows
> the industry to adjust to evolving requirements such as changes in the market.

IaaS, using an internet service model to leverage resources that are traditionally
found in an organization's own data center, such as storage and compute.
- avoiding the expense of buying hardware and software, shifting spending from
  CapEx to OpEx.

SaaS, a third party provider hosts application software on behalf of the end users.
- removes the need for enterprises to spend a large amount of money on enterprise
software
- almost unlimited scalability for growing enterprises
- no need to update or patch the software, updates are continuous and automatic

PaaS, a third party service provides application development, testing, and
deployment, and hosting services as a service.
- make application development more cost effective.
- more turnkey than a traditional development workflow.
- reduces the complexity of building, testing and deploying applications

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

Private Cloud: ability to control the physical servers, ability to control who accesses the systems; 
significant investment of funds, lags in capability

Public Clouds: possible cost saving, agility, continuous improvement; need to give up control, more
expense when not optimized for existing public cloud providers, loss of physical server control, 

Hybrid clouds: advantages of public clouds, run number of systems, flexibility; cost, maintenance,
more complex

Multi clouds: Leverage the best cloud services, able to consideer all services, find the most value;
similar to hybrid cloud, complex deployment

## Cloud Computing Services

- Cloud storage
- Cloud compute
- Cloud databases
- Cloud AI

Some others:

- On-demand security services, e.g., encryption and authentication services
- Cloud governance services
